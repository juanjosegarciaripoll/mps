/*!\defgroup TheMPS Matrix product states

   A Matrix Product State (MPS) represents a 1D quantum state made of N sites,
   particles or spins. Each site has a tensor associated to it, so that the
   whole state may be written as a contraction of these tensors
   \f[
   |\psi\rangle = \sum_{i,\alpha,\beta} A^{i_1}_{\alpha_1\alpha_2}
   A^{i_2}_{\alpha_2\alpha_3}\cdot A^{i_N}_{\alpha_N,\alpha_1}
   |i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_N\rangle
   \f]
   Each of the tensors in this product may be different and have different sizes.
   The indices \f$i_k\f$ denote the physical state of the k-th site. The indices
   \f$\alpha_k\f$ have no direct physical interpretation. However, the larger the
   these indices can be, the more accurately we can approximate arbitrary states
   using the previous representation. Finally, in problems with open boundary
   conditions, the index \f$\alpha_1\f$ need only have size 1.

   From the point of view of the programmer, a MPS is just a collection of
   tensors. The user is allowed to put and retrieve the tensor associated to
   the k-th site using get(k) or set(k,A), where A is the new tensor. Each tensor
   typically has three indices and is organized as A(a,i,b), where \c a and \c b
   are the \f$\alpha\f$ and \f$\beta\f$ from the previous formula, and \c i
   is the phyisical degree of freedom.

   Other operations, such as orthogonalize() or orthonormalize() are related
   to the \ref Algorithms algorithms for evolution and computation of ground
   states.

   Finally, since the MPS are actually vectors, one can compute the norm(),
   a scalar product with scprod(), expected values with correlation(), or
   obtain a vector that represents the same state with to_basis().
